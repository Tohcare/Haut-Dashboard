## Report Design and Visualization
TThe report canvas was designed in power point and imported into power BI as canvas background, Here is a sample of the design in power point.  
Five pages were created namely;
•	the home pages
•	consolidation page
•	stationery page
•	cosmetic page
•	electronic page

The Home page displays the supermarket name, logo and icons to other pages. From the home page users can navigate through other pages; the stationery page, cosmetic and electronic page.
