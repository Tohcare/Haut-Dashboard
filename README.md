## The following are the power Bi skills demonstrated:
+ Project Planning and Documentation
+ Data Analysis Expression (DAX)
+ Scalability
+ Page navigation and button
+ Data Modeling
+ Data Visualization
+ Report Design
+ Performance Optimization
  
## Data Modelling
During the process of data visualization and dashboard creation, two tables were created in power Bi named the fact table and the dimension table. There is one fact table and Two-dimension tables
The fact table and dimension table are comprised of the following columns from which the primary and foreign keys are derived.

## Report Design and Visualization
TThe report canvas was designed in power point and imported into power BI as canvas background, Here is a sample of the design in power point.  
Five pages were created namely;
•	the home pages
•	consolidation page
•	stationery page
•	cosmetic page
•	electronic page

The Home page displays the supermarket name, logo and icons to other pages. From the home page users can navigate through other pages; the stationery page, cosmetic and electronic page.
